export default Layout;

### What we're gonna cover

- 🔢 Macros
- 🌊 Usefulness
- 🔨 Exapaded Use
- 🚀 Future

<Notes>
- Macros: bit about them, and the problem it sets out to solve
    - Uses in other languages
- Usefulness: their usefulness in day to day development and reducing overhead
- Exapaded Use: from macros to babel plugin macros and what we get out of it
- Future: endless possibilities leveraging macros and more

- Exapanded use in JS

-

#### Macros

> Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, like small code generators.

🤔💭

<Notes>

- macros are going to happen at compile time. where a function is going to happen at run time.

- code that writes code. 🤔 This is less readable, understandable, and maintainable then general functions.

- executes "preprocessor statements" at compilation time, and the output of this execution forms part of the code that is compiled.

- tons of languages use macros

- Examples include Scala, Rust, Elixir, Julia, Haskell, C, LISP

</Notes>

<CMacro />

<Notes>
Here C file with several macros:

the '#' or 'hashtag' is a macro preprocessor that let's you define macros!

1. include -> header file like an 'import'

2 define -> to define a function 'PrintExpr'

3 prefix value with x0's added to non-zero values.

the mathmatical operation as a string !
Without using a macro, there is no way to capture the text string "2+2" so we can print it.

# Cool 😎

What's this got to do with JavaScript ?

<Image
  style={{ width: "400px", height: "400px", display: "inline-block" }}
  src={require("file-loader!./assets/compiling.png")}
/>

<Notes>
- so now we have a quick understanding of a macro, and it's usefulness ...

xkdc cartoon i've always loved

- used to wait for npm install
- now we wait for compile and bundling
- let's make the most of that effort

</Notes>

export default Layout;

```

{
"presets": ["react", "es2015", "stage-0"],

    "plugins": [
      "transform-runtime",
      "add-module-exports",
      "transform-decorators-legacy",
      "transform-react-display-name"
    ],

    "env": {
      "development": {
        "plugins": [
          "typecheck",
          ["react-transform", {
              "transforms": [{
                  "transform": "react-transform-catch-errors",
                  "imports": ["react", "redbox-react"]
                }
              ]
          }]
        ]
      }
    }

}

```

<Notes>

- And these things are amazing!!!!
- Transform Plugins
- Modules
- Experimental
- Minification
- Syntax Plugins
- Pluging Ordering [**THIS MATTERS**](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#plugin-options)
- Presets

Do they run out of order?
**BUT THERE ARE SOME GACHATS**

</Notes>

# 🤕 Pain Points 💣

- 😵 Confusion
- 🌎 Global
- 😈 Conflict

<Notes>

- They can lead to _confusion_ because when looking at code in a project, you might not know that there's a plugin transforming that code.
- They have to be _globally configured_ or configured out-of-band (in a .babelrc or webpack config).
- They can _conflict_ in very confusing ways due to the fact that all babel plugins run simultaneously (on a single walk of Babel's AST).

</Notes>

# ZERO CONFIG

<a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/09/11/zero-config-with-babel-macros">
  <img width="420px" src={require("file-loader!./assets/zero-cool.png")} />
</a>

<Notes>

- Can we have all those awesome features and mitigate these painpoints?
- Can we get that with zero configurbility?

</Notes>

Macros to the rescue 🦹‍♀️🦸‍♀️

<Notes>

- These are to painpoint that babel-plugin-macros sets out to solve
- It's idea is to make babel code transformation more accessiable.

- The import is there and used explicitly.
- babel-plugin-macros needs to be added to your config, but only once,
- No need to update ESLint config because it's explicit.
- If you misconfigure babel-plugin-macros then you'll get a much more friendly compile time error message

##### [idx](https://github.com/dralletje/idx.macro) In Action 👾

```js
const friends_of_friends =
  props.user == null
    ? props.user
    : props.user.friends == null
    ? props.user.friends
    : props.user.friends[0] == null
    ? props.user.friends[0]
    : props.user.friends[0].friends;
```

<Notes>

- Nested object Checks
- We've all been there
- Looking for user friends whose in an array of friends of the current user ?
- Monster ternary statements!

</Notes>

---

export default FullScreenCode;

```js
type User = {
  user: ?{
    name: string,
    friends: ?Array<User>
  }
};
props.user &&
  props.user.friends &&
  props.user.friends[0] &&
  props.user.friends[0].friends;
```

<Notes>

- Here's the structure of the type we're traversing
- We might use contional logic to keep checking
  - "if the user exists, and has friends, and that friend has friends"

</Notes>

---

```js
import idx from "idx.macro";

const friends_of_friends = idx(props, _ => _.user.friends[0].friends);
```

<Notes>

- idx is going to take 2 arguments, the object and a function that returns 1 or more of the nested member expressions of said object
- and bc we're using it as a macro, there's no plugin config needed!
- naming convention for macros is usually with a "\*.macro"

- and that looks good, but maybe we code push it a bit further?

</Notes>

#### Babel Language Extentions

```js
// #['optional-chaining']

const friends_of_friends = user?.friends[0]?.friends;
```

---

export default FullScreenCode;

```js
// #['pipe-operator']
let result = exclaim(capitalize(doubleSay("hello")));
result; //=> "Hello, hello!"

//Now with pipes
let result = "hello" |> doubleSay |> capitalize |> exclaim;
result; //=> "Hello, hello!"
```

<Notes>

- something like pragma in Haskell
- declared at the top of any used file, like imports, so you always know

- GHC supports several pragmas, or instructions to the compiler placed in the source code. Pragmas don't normally affect the meaning of the program, but they might affect the efficiency of the generated code.

<div style={{ fontSize: 40 }}>
  <ul

    }}
  >
    <li style={{ padding: "10px" }}>📚 Code that continues to be readable</li>
    <li style={{ padding: "10px" }}>
      👨‍🚀 Code that is easy for future us to reason about
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<Notes>
  Language Extenstions allow us to be more surgical with our decisions, and not
  paint our language with such a broad brush strokes.

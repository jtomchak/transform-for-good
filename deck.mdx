##### Macros

> Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which is known as metaprogramming.

ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜´

<Notes>

- macro is going to happen at compile time. where a function is going to happen at run time.

- code that writes code. ðŸ¤” This is less readable, understandable, and maintainable then general functions.

- tons of languages use macros

- Haskell, C, Rust, LISP

<CodeDemo language="c" />

Output ðŸ˜±

```bash
2 + 2 = 4
```

<Notes>
  Here C has 3 macros 1 to include the header file like an 'import' 2 to define
  a function 'PrintExpr' 3 in the function to refer to the value passed into
  that function

Without using a macro, there is no way to capture the text string "2+2" so we can print it.

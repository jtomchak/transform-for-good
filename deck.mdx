##### Macros

> Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which is known as metaprogramming.

ðŸ˜ªðŸ˜´

<Notes>

- macros are going to happen at compile time. where a function is going to happen at run time.

- code that writes code. ðŸ¤” This is less readable, understandable, and maintainable then general functions.

- tons of languages use macros

- Haskell, C, Rust, LISP

<CMacro />

<Notes>
  Here C has 3 macros 1 to include the 
  1. header file like an 'import' 
  2 to define
  a function 'PrintExpr' 
  3 in the function to refer to the value passed into
  that function

Without using a macro, there is no way to capture the text string "2+2" so we can print it.

# Cool ðŸ˜Ž

What's this got to do with JavaScript ?

<Image
  style={{ width: "400px", height: "400px", display: "inline-block" }}

/>

<Notes>

- used to wait for npm install
- now we wait for transpile / bundling
- let's make the most of that effort
